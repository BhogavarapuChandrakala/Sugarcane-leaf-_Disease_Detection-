# 🌿 Sugarcane Leaf Disease Detection - Streamlit Web App

This project aims to automate the detection and classification of sugarcane leaf diseases using deep learning. Built with **Streamlit**, **EfficientNetB0**, and trained on a robust dataset, it provides an accessible interface for farmers, researchers, and agritech enthusiasts to get real-time disease predictions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Manual identification of sugarcane diseases is slow, subjective, and error-prone. Our goal is to use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect five key sugarcane leaf conditions: **Healthy, Mosaic, Red Rot, Rust, and Yellow Disease** — providing early detection and actionable insights.
